# Image Deblurring Unet based AutoEncoder
In many real world applications, sometimes there is a need to zoom a specific area of 
interest in the image without the loss of quality i.e having a high resolution image, 
e.g. in surveillance and  space imaging applications.

Having high resolution imaging setups is not always possible so I'm experimenting with 
Autoencoders to make a low computation De-blurring model
